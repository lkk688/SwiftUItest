# SwiftUItest
Check the SwiftUI2 version here: [myAppSwiftUI2](https://github.com/lkk688/myAppSwiftUI2)

This is the SwiftUI sample code used in SJSU CMPE277 class. This sample code contains multiple steps of efforts to learn SwiftUI, including most components of SwiftUI, data dependencies, and MVVM pattern. In addition to the UI design, this sample code added networking and location function to showcase the basic iOS URLSession and the new Combine framework with network. The backend folder extends the network function to custom backend based on Google Firebase Cloud function. Use cases of Firebase authentication, remote messaging, notification, and Firestore are also added. The Vision folder added the test cases of playing the Apple Vision framework for photo-based image classification and object detection. Custom CoreML models are also added for the image classification. The last part includes a camera realtime image classification, object detection via custom CoreML models, and face detection.

To limit the size of the respository, the Pods folder is not included. The Google firebase GoogleService-Info.plist file is also not included.
